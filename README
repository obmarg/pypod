pypod - A simple python podcatcher with a web interface
---

pypod is a simple podcatcher written in python written with the intention of 
running as a daemon on computers with no monitor, or where keeping a constant
GUI running would be an inconvenience.


License
---
pypod is avaliable under a BSD license as detailed in the LICENSE file

Though additionally if anyone does end up using this code I'd be happy to
get some feedback, or just an email to let me know where it has ended up.


Dependencies
---
pypod runs using python, so that will definitely be required.  It was developed
for python 2.7, though may work under other versions.

Additionally, the following python packages are required:
	jinja2
	feedparser

Assuming python setuptools is installed, these can be installed by running:

easy_install jinja2 feedparser
